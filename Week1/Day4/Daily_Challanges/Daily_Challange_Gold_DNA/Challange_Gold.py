EXPERIMENT DATE: {random.choice(['2024-03-15', '2024-03-22', '2024-03-28'])}
RESEARCHER: AI Biology Lab

HYPOTHESIS:
Through random mutations influenced by environmental factors, organisms 
can evolve from random DNA sequences to optimal sequences (all 1s) 
through natural selection pressures.

METHODOLOGY:
- Created 10 organisms with random DNA (10 chromosomes √ó 10 genes each)
- Each gene starts as random 0 or 1
- Environment mutation rate: 30%
- Target: All genes = 1 (perfect fitness = 100%)

RESULTS:
"""
    
    if results:
        notebook_entry += f"‚úÖ SUCCESS ACHIEVED!\n"
        for organism, generation, org_id in results:
            notebook_entry += f"- Organism {org_id} reached perfection at generation {generation}\n"
        
        avg_generations = statistics.mean(gen for _, gen, _ in results)

    else:
        notebook_entry += f"‚ùå No organisms reached perfection within {final_generation} generations\n"
    
    notebook_entry += f"""
OBSERVATIONS:
- Mutation rate significantly affects evolution speed
- Higher environmental pressure leads to faster evolution
- Some organisms may get "stuck" in local optima
- Random mutations can both help and hinder progress

CONCLUSIONS:
This simulation demonstrates key evolutionary principles:
1. **Random Variation**: Mutations provide genetic diversity
2. **Selection Pressure**: Environmental conditions drive evolution
3. **Inheritance**: Genetic information is preserved and modified
4. **Time Scale**: Evolution requires many generations

The polymorphic design (Mutable interface) allows different biological 
components to mutate in their own specific ways, while inheritance 
creates a natural hierarchy from genes ‚Üí chromosomes ‚Üí DNA ‚Üí organisms.

FUTURE RESEARCH:
- Test different mutation rates
- Implement sexual reproduction (crossover)
- Add environmental selection pressure
- Study population dynamics
